### Codable protocol
A type that can convert itself into and out of an external representation such as Json.

- 01codable_A: Basic JSON parsing in Swift
- 01codable_B: Using CODABLE Protocol
- 01codable_C: Choosing Properties to Encode and Decode — CodingKeys, Custom date format, limitations

### Functions + tuple
You can use a tuple type as the return type for a function to return multiple values as part of one compound return value.

- Example: split meetings in groups (earlier, this week, later)

### Protocols + default implementation + constraints
A protocol defines a suite of behavior that can be adopted by class, struct or enumeration

You can use protocol extensions to provide a default implementation to any method or computed property requirement of that protocol.

When you define a protocol extension, you can specify constraints that conforming types must satisfy before the methods and properties of the extension are available.

- Example: search people by criteria that have nothing in common [City, Food, Work], protocol Searchable
