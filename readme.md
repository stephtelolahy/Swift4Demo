### Codable protocol
A type that can convert itself into and out of an external representation such as Json.

- `01codable_A.playground`: Basic JSON parsing in Swift
- `01codable_B.playground`: Using CODABLE Protocol
- `01codable_C.playground`: Choosing Properties to Encode and Decode — CodingKeys, Custom date format, limitations

### Functions + tuple
You can use a tuple type as the return type for a function to return multiple values as part of one compound return value.

- `02tuple.playground`: split meetings in groups (earlier, this week, later)

### Protocols
A protocol defines a suite of behavior that can be adopted by class, struct or enumeration

- `03protocol_A.playground`: protocol with default implementation
- `03protocol_C.playground`: search people by criteria that have nothing in common [City, Food, Movie] using protocol approach
