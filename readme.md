### Functions + tuple
You can use a tuple type as the return type for a function to return multiple values as part of one compound return value.

- Example03: split movies that are released this month and earlier


### Protocols + default implementation + constraints
A protocol defines a suite of behavior that can be adopted by class, struct or enumeration

You can use protocol extensions to provide a default implementation to any method or computed property requirement of that protocol.

When you define a protocol extension, you can specify constraints that conforming types must satisfy before the methods and properties of the extension are available.

- Example01: get nearby friends
- Example04: print array of tags that have nothing in common [Animal, Country, Food]
- Example02: check if array content has changed

### Generic functions

Generic code enables you to write flexible, reusable functions and types that can work with any type, subject to requirements that you define.

- Example05: intanciate specific ViewController, TableViewCell from Storyboard

### Codable protocol

A type that can convert itself into and out of an external representation (Json for example).

- Example06: parse array of burgers with compound objects
